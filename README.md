Sprint Review and Retrospective document for a given project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs in this project happened when we conducted interviews with groups of end-users and results in the defining of specific requirements that the software should satisfy. We implement these requirements through the use of user stories and a product backlog. The user stories help by providing clear, concise, and well-defined goals for how the product should impact the end-user. The product backlog helps with us organizing these user stories in a way that will provide maximum value to the client and user at each step of the development process. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The approach that was used for developing this program was Scrum-Agile. The Agile process that I hope to incorporate in my future development work is Extreme Programming (XP). XP seems to be another popoular process for developing software in today's software development world and I would really be interested to learn more about it and how it is incorporated with a project now that I have seen how the Scrum-Agile process works.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, to be a good team member in software developement means that you have to be an effective communicator and willing to understand things from other people's perspectives. Communication is one of the most important skills to have in a team setting whether it be communicating that you need help with something or explaining something to someone else, communicating effectively helps to ensure a cohesive team unit. I think that understanding things from other's perspectives plays into the communication aspect, but it helps to broaden how you view a project. In my experience as a team member, I believe it is really easy for someone to get hyper-focused on how an issue affects what they do, but can't view it from other angles or how it affects the project as a whole.
